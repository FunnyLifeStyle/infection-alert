# Infection Alert

Early Infection Alert based on resting heart rate elevation.

Infections elevate your resting heart rate, sometimes even before you can feel the symptoms or the temperature is elevated. 

Wearables provide an accurate way to measure resting heart rate during sleep by wearing the watch during the night.

We first create a personal baseline over a couple of nights, then every morning compare the recording with the previous baseline.

The data is analymously uploaded to a public server.
