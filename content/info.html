# Infection Alert

Infections raise your resting heart rate, sometimes even before you can feel the symptoms.

This app analyzes heart rate from the Apple Watch and shows you if your heart rate is elevated above your personalized baseline.

Anonymized heart rates and approximate locations are stored on a public server so we can study the spread of the infections through the population.

Any researcher will be able to access the anonymized data.

This is not a coronavirus detection app. Any type of infection or being overworked, training too hard, etc. could elevate your resting heart rate during sleep.

## Open Source and Open Data

The source code of this app is available on GitHub at https://github.com/unrelatedlabs/infection-alert .

Access to public data is available at https://github.com/unrelatedlabs/infection-alert/tree/master/data .
